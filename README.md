# Recipe App (Command Line Version)

## Objective

Build the command line version of a Recipe app as a precursor to its web app counterpart in Achievement 2. This project focuses on learning Python fundamentals, data structures, and object-oriented programming, preparing you for Django web framework development.

## Context

The project involves building a command line application in Python for managing recipes, including features like creating, reading, modifying, and searching for recipes based on ingredients. It serves as a demonstration of Python scripting skills and understanding of fundamental programming concepts.

## The 5 W’s

1. **Who:** My professional network and potential employers interested in my Python skills.
2. **What:** Command line application for a Recipe app with CRUD operations and ingredient-based searching.
3. **When:** Code available on GitHub, requiring a local Python 3.6+ installation for easy access by recruiters.
4. **Where:** Run on any machine with Python installed. Host the code on GitHub or my portfolio site.
5. **Why:** Showcase my Python skills and potential to work with web application frameworks like Django.

## User Goals

- Create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and auto-calculated difficulty.
- Search for recipes by ingredients.

## Key Features

- CRUD operations for user recipes stored in a locally hosted MySQL database.
- Ingredient-based recipe search.
- Automatic difficulty rating for recipes.
- Detailed recipe display including ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty.

## Technical Requirements

- Handle common exceptions and errors with user-friendly messages.
- Connect to a locally hosted MySQL database.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface with simple forms and concise instructions.
- Compatible with Python 3.6+.
- Well-formatted code following standardized guidelines.
- Include concise comments illustrating the program flow.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Set up a local MySQL database.
4. Install required dependencies.
5. Run the application.

## Usage

- Follow on-screen instructions to manage recipes.
- Use the search option to find recipes based on ingredients.

## Developer Actions

Exercise 1: Intro to Python Programming
● Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux
● Create and manage virtual environments
● Use pip to install and manage packages

Exercise 2: Data Types in Python
● Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their
own internal data
● Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

Exercise 3: Functions and Other Operations in Python
● Create your first script on a .py script file
● Build a script that uses if-elif-else statements, for loops, and functions to take recipes from the
user then display them

Exercise 4: File Handling in Python
● Create a Python script that takes recipes from the user and writes the data in a binary file
● Create another script that reads the binary file and lists out the available ingredients. The user
chooses an ingredient and the script displays all recipes which contain it
● Use Python’s exception handling features to handle common errors

Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python
● Build a custom class for your recipes, which contains its own data attributes for name,
ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty, as well as other custom methods to interact with this
data

Exercise 6: Connecting to Databases in Python
● Set up a MySQL database and connect your scripts to it
● Build an application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes recipes, as well as searching for
them by a single ingredient

Exercise 7: Finalizing Your Python Program
● Use an Object Relational Mapper from SQLAlchemy to manage the contents of your database
from your application
● Build a user-friendly menu for entering and searching recipes and ingredients
● Store recipe and ingredient data in a MySQL database
● Implement recipe search according to user-defined ingredients
● Implement a detailed display of the recipe selected by the user
